- Responsible for consumer video applications across FOX, FOX Sports, FX, and National Geographic, ie. FOXNOW, FXNOW, etc...

- Build APIs and services for client applications across all platforms

### About me

- At FOX 1.5 years, at Disney/ABC before that almost 10 years.

- Background as a full stack developer.

name: goals0
### Goals

#### Microservices have to follow a set of rules and structures to be succesful
- Microservices have to know how to communicate with one another. Having a standard API format is crucial.

- Microservices have to know how to find each other.

- They have to be aware that they may have more than one consumer.

---
name: goals1
### Goals

#### Content/Data management (CMS) needs to be based on the same services as the client apps.
 - Client (iOS/Android app/etc...) always sees the same thing as the editor in the CMS.
 So CMS is really just a React/Redux front end for the same services that the client app uses.

 - Data can be sourced can be from a variety of places, each with different levels of quality or rules.
 So we need a way to translate or update the content before it is used.

 - Ability to override a single field on any platform but still inherit other fields.

 - Need to have different layers of APIs. General apis and BFF (Backends for Frontends) apis.
---
name: goals2
### Goals

#### Documentation needs to be simple and based on code.
 - Documentation is time consuming and will always get out of sync with code. So make it based on the code.

 - Exceptions happen so framework needs to be flexible to match.

 - Use Hypermedia driven web APIs, so that the apis are discoverable.

 - Products like apigee127 take similar but opposite approach.

---
name: models
##### Sample model:
```js
const SeriesModel = new Schema({
  approved: {
    type: Boolean,
  },
  contentFlags: {
    type: [String],
  },
  fullEpisodeCount: {
    type: Number,
  },
  previewVideo: {
    type: Collection,
    ref: 'Video',
    fields: ['@id', '@type', 'playerScreenUrl'],
  },
});
```

##### Sample draft (in) translation:
```js
class SeriesDraftTranslation extends Translation {
  contentFlags() {
    _.uniq(this._all('contentFlags').map(x => x.toLowerCase());
  }
}
```

##### Sample published (out) translation:
```js
class SeriesPublishedTranslation extends Translation {
  approved() {
    return this._get('cms.approved') && this._any('restriced') === false;
  }

  fullEpisodeCount() {
    return Video.count({ showId: this.id });
  }
}
```

name: goals3
### Goals

#### Easy for developers to work with, replicate, and deploy
 - Need to be able to run the entire environment and all services locally.

 - Desire to use the same tools and tooling that we work with everyday, whether you are developing a service, deploying code, or
 changing the infrastructure.

 - Need to be able to stamp out multiple environments or alternate builds with minimal effort.

 - Reuse code when possible, but not at the expense of keeping separation of services.

---
name: docker
.left-column[.image[![Docker](images/docker-logo.png)]]
.right-column[
### Docker
  - Provides us with consistent deployment artifacts.

  - Leverage a library of already built docker images. No need to worry about how to install consul, redis, elasticsearch, etc...

  - Easily share configuration amongst developers.

  - Docker compose allows us to simulate the entire environment.

  - Really easy to utilize environment variables as switches.

  - Utilizes our resources more effectively. Run multiple microservices on a single instance.

  - With terraform we can spin up an entire stack of microservices very quickly for one off tests or separate tests.

name: lambda
### Why not use Lambda?

 - It is the future.

 - We still like to have visibility and full control of the application.

 - All of our code is actually built to work as a controller or as a handler function with Lambda so we can switch when ready.

 - When we started the local development and tooling wasn't quite ready.

#### What is it?
]
.right-column[
### Lerna and monorepos
#### What is a monorepo?
- A large _monolithic_ repository, aka monorepo.

- A repository that contains more than one project. In our case, all of our microservices and relevant files.

.left-column[.image[![Lerna](images/lerna-logo.png)]
#### What is it?
#### Why?
]
.right-column[
### Lerna and monorepos
#### Why would you do _that_?
 - Keeps dependencies together which simplifies managing the code.

 - Better sharing and knowledge of components.

 - Challenging to enforce standardization and tests of code across repositories. For example, eslintrc.

 - Code reviews happening across multiple repos and devs don't always look in more than one place.

 - PR's across multiple repositories results in chicken and egg scenarios.

 - Branching or new versions of code much easier to implement.

 - Intergration and e2e tests that leverage multiple services are much easier

 - Git submodules are complex and error-prone

#### What is it?
#### Why?
#### Cons
]
.right-column[
### Lerna and monorepos
#### What are the challenges of using a monorepo?
 - Most CI and CD tools are going to require some customization to streamline the build.

 - We want our docker containers to be small, so we can't stick the entire codebase into the image. That requires
 custom scripting to accomplish.

 - If you do that, then some code duplication might be necessary, but it's still possible to keep it limited.

name: lerna
### What is Lerna?
.quote[
Lerna is a tool that optimizes the workflow around managing multi-package repositories with git and npm.

#### Features:
- provides a structure to monorepos
```
lerna.json
package.json
packages/
 - shared_package/
 -   node_modules
 -   package.json
 - service1/
 -   node_modules
 -   package.json
 - service2/
 -   node_modules
 -   package.json
```
- provides an interface for publishing to npm, tagging in git, and semantic version control

### Terraform
- Infrastructure as code. Essentially a "developer" friendly version of managing infrastructure.

- Because it is "code", you can use all the same tools as you would for development - linting, testing,
CI/CD, collaboration, code reviews, change requests, change tracking, automation, etc...

- Supports a "dry-run" to tell you in advance what will change.

- Supports saving state remotely in s3 and locking to prevent multiple people changing the infrastructure at the same time.

- Has support for variables (and some functions) so you can easily stamp out environments for QA, Staging, Production.

- You can even spin up one-off environments, so that a developer can test all of their changes in a separate environment.

- Supports modules to break infrastucture into components, ie. network, services, etc...

- Cloud agnostic. Use for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc...

### Consul
- High availability service registry and discovery.

- Provides a DNS interface for services to ask for a microservice by name and port.

- Service discovery supports health checks to route requests to healthy hosts.

- Leverage tags to search for services by name or tags.

- Registrator automatically discovers ports that are being used in a docker container and registers them to consul

- SERVICE_TAGS and SERVICE_NAME environment fields automatically name/tag the fields in consul

### Pulling it all together

#### Our apis and services all really have three main customers/consumers
- Our other micro services and content indexers
  - Use Consul as the DNS to find healthly services
  - Use a hystrix pattern to request data and to protect services
  - Put microservices on a private subnet in a VPC

- The CMS - it's just a front end for our APIs
  - Use a application load balancer (ALB) on a public subnet to distribute the routing to the
  appropriate services as the CMS client expects them.
  - Because it's for internal purposes we can more easily use a AWS and an ALB to restrict the security group and access.

- External clients - iOS, Android, web, etc...
 - Use a different application load balancer which is more restrictive.
 - Use API Gateway to easily route, version control, throttle, cache, limit requests
 - Client apis need to have multiple paths. Base level REST apis are great for some applications (like the CMS), but specialized
BFF* apis (Backends for Frontends)

.footnote[*BFF is a concept coined by Sam Newman http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/ ]
